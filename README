xoyuz - союз
=============

"Союз" is a Russian word that means means "union" or "united", the correct
transliteration is "søyuz", but you already must know our policy about
X-project-naming convention. ;)

This is a Django application that helps us to improve serving static files in
production unifying and minifying them.


Installation
============

In your settings.py:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'xoyuz',
        ...
    )

Ensure you have installed `yui-compressor`.


Usage
=====

In the templates where there was:

    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/file.js">
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/other_file.js">
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/another_file.js">

Now you can write:

    {% load xoyuz %}

    {% resources 'js/file.js' 'js/other_file.js' 'js/another_file.js' %}

This will write the same than above in development, but when you do DEBUG=True
This outputs something like:

    <script src="/media/resources/567debe09c122151a284a3183da3689b.min.js">

That file is a minified concatenation of the three files before.


WARNING! - ВНИМАНИЕ!
=====================

- The first request of a new resource bundle will take some time because the
  files are being concatenated and minified.

- Do not mix in a `resources` sentence CSS and JavaScript.

- Every time you deploy again run `python manage.py cleanminification` to
  delete old generated files.
